  - description: Iâ€™m a software engineer with a BA in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Education from MSU Denver, currently enrolled at the Turing School of Software and Design. I specialize in designing and implementing efficient, user-focused software solutions, with certifications in Python, C#, C++, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as hands-on experience with Git/GitHub for collaborative development. My problem-solving mindset was shaped by over two years as a student teacher, where I developed creative solutions to engage learners and optimize processes. I now apply that same innovation and adaptability to software engineering, striving to build impactful solutions that drive results.
