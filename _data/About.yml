    description: "I’m a software engineer with a BA in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Education from MSU Denver. I started my journey into software development early in my time at university, coding as a fun hobby. After determining that teaching wasn’t the right fit for me—despite developing a strong problem-solving and growth mindset—I decided to pursue a career in software development. On my own, I taught myself the fundamentals, and I now have certificates and experience in many languages and frameworks, and I'm always working to learn new ones. I hit a point where I knew that I needed more support in my learning and applied to the Turing School of Software and Design, where I have honed my skills and elevated my confidence as a developer. Moving into the future, I aim to work for companies on web applications that benefit not only the individual user but entire communities. I highly value community, transparency, respect, and integrity, and want to help develop technology for the betterment of society. Outside of software, I enjoy many hobbies including crochet, singing/piano, board games, and hiking."
